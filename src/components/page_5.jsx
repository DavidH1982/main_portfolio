                            Regardless of whether I find work in development soon or not, I am determined that this is the industry I want to be a part of, and so I now need to start the ongoing building of my skills. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Moving forward, I intend to continue studying Javascript, getting to grips with all the nuances, and doing daily challenges on sites such as <a href='https://www.codewars.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' id='codewarsLink'>code wars</a> to improve my skills. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            I am going to commit to putting in at least two hours every day into learning Python, Sass CSS, UI/UX design fundamentals, and design principals such as colour theory and mobile responsiveness. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            One of the main skills I want to get into a habit if doing is using 3rd party libraries. Other than the projects, nothing in this portfolio has used a library, as I want to demonstrate my abilities. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            I am also interested in looking into content creation techniques, and the different languages used to aim at different target audiences. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            My longer term aspirations are to incorporate my interest in 3D modelling with my development skills perhaps in game development, technical website design, or working specifically with architecture &amp; interior design companies and promote their services. <br/>
